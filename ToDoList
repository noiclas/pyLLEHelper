Figure out tf is going on with the fig.show and/or return fig stuff. Ideally I wouldnt want to be returning a bunch of fig objects,
	but fig.show() does not work in jupyter lab.

	Maybe even completely switch to pyplot. The information is exactly the same. Plotly just allows you to zoom in and pan.
